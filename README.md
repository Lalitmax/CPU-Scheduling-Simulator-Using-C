# CPU Scheduling Simulator

## Overview

The CPU Scheduling Simulator is a project designed to demonstrate various CPU scheduling algorithms and their performance. This simulator includes implementations of several key scheduling techniques, such as:

- **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**
- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
- **Round-Robin (RR)**
- **Priority Scheduling**

The project allows users to input job data, select scheduling algorithms, and view the scheduling results.

## Features

- **FCFS Scheduling**: Executes jobs in the order they arrive.
- **SJF Scheduling**: Executes jobs with the shortest execution time first.
- **RR Scheduling**: Cycles through jobs with a fixed time slice.
- **Priority Scheduling**: Executes jobs based on priority levels.

## Requirements

- **Language**: C
- **Compiler**: GCC (or any standard C compiler)

## Installation

To build and run the CPU Scheduling Simulator, follow these steps:
