# CPU Scheduling Simulator

## Overview

The **CPU Scheduling Simulator** is a C-based project designed to demonstrate various CPU scheduling algorithms and their performance. The simulator includes implementations of several key scheduling techniques, such as:

- **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**: Executes jobs in the order they arrive.
- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**: Executes jobs with the shortest execution time first.
- **Round-Robin (RR)**: Cycles through jobs with a fixed time slice (quantum).
- **Priority Scheduling**: Executes jobs based on priority levels.

The project allows users to input job data, select scheduling algorithms, and view the scheduling results.

## Features

- **FCFS Scheduling**: Executes jobs in the order they arrive.
- **SJF Scheduling**: Executes jobs with the shortest execution time first.
- **RR Scheduling**: Cycles through jobs with a fixed time slice.
- **Priority Scheduling**: Executes jobs based on priority levels.
- **File Input Support**: Allows scheduling input via `.txt` files for easy testing and simulation.

## Requirements

- **Language**: C
- **Compiler**: GCC (or any standard C compiler)
- **Development Platform**: Linux (Kali, Ubuntu) or macOS (or any POSIX-compliant system)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/CPUSchedulingSimulator.git
   ```

2. Compile the project:
   ```bash
   gcc -o test_output main.c -L. cpu_scheduling_algo.a
   ```

## Running the Simulator

Once compiled, you can run the simulator by providing test case files as input:

```bash
./test_output
```

### Input File Structure in the Test Cases Folder

Each test case file should have the following format:
```
AlgorithmName.txt  (specify which algorithm to perform)
```

Example:

```
AlgorithmName = PriorityScheduling
```

Specific Algorithm Details:

- **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) File Name Should be FirstComeFirstServe.txt**:
  ```
  NoOfProcess = 4
  ArrivalTime = 0 1 5 6  (list of arrival times)
  BurstTime = 2 2 3 4  (list of burst times)
  ```

- **Round-Robin (RR) File Name Should be RoundRobin.txt**:
  ```
  NoOfProcess = 4
  ArrivalTime = 0 1 2 4
  BurstTime = 5 4 2 1
  QuantumTime = 2  (time slice, only for RR)
  ```

- **Shortest Job First (SJF) File Name Should be ShortestJobFirst.txt**:
  ```
  Mode = Preemptive
  NoOfProcess = 6
  ArrivalTime = 0 1 2 3 4 5
  BurstTime = 8 4 2 1 3 2
  ```

- **Priority Scheduling File Name Should be PriorityScheduling.txt**:
  ```
  NoOfProcess = 4
  Priority = 10 20 30 40  (list of priorities, only for Priority Scheduling)
  ArrivalTime = 0 1 2 4
  BurstTime = 5 4 2 1
  ```

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from developers! To contribute to the project, follow the steps below:

### 1. Fork the repository:
   Fork the repository on GitHub to start working on your own copy.

### 2. Clone your fork:
   Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CPUSchedulingSimulator.git
   ```

### 3. Create a new branch:
   Create a new branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/scheduling-algorithm
   ```

### 4. Make your changes:
   Implement your improvements, fixes, or features, such as adding new scheduling algorithms, optimizing existing ones, or improving the UI/UX of the simulation.

### 5. Run Tests:
   Ensure your code works correctly by running the simulator with different test cases.

   - Place your test cases in the `Test Cases/` folder.
   - Each test case should follow the **Input File Structure** mentioned earlier.
   - For example, `AlgorithmName.txt` should specify the algorithm to be performed.
   
   Compile the code:
   ```bash
   gcc -o test_output main.c -L. cpu_scheduling_algo.a
   ```

   Run the code:
   ```bash
   ./test_output
   ```

### 6. Commit and push:
   Commit your changes and push them to your fork:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added feature for <your-feature>"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### 7. Create a pull request:
   Open a pull request (PR) on GitHub with a description of your changes and the problem it solves.

### 8. Code Review:
   The maintainers will review your PR and, once approved, it will be merged into the main branch.

This updated documentation should help contributors understand how to get started and contribute to your project effectively.
